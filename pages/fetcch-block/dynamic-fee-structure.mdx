# Dynamic Fee Structure

- As transfers occur, excessively one-sided demand can cause pool imbalances, with high liquidity in well-liked source pools and low liquidity in pools with strong demand as destinations. Bridge transfers wonâ€™t succeed in these situations unless the liquidity is balanced again.

- Hence we use the dynamic fee model by [`hyphen`](https://www.notion.so/On-Chain-Payment-Request-2a07409aa1ff4db08437cb278c205847). In this model the transfer fee is determined by pool available liquidity, pools are independent of external AMMs, and native bridges are not required to carry out rebalancing.
