# Misc

> **Tools Used**

### Foundry

- We utilize foundry to manage dependencies, compile, run test cases, and deploy smart contracts.

### Slither

- Slither is what we use to analyze smart contracts statically. It executes a number of vulnerability scanners, outputs visual information about the terms of the contract, and offers an API for quickly creating unique studies.

### MythX

- For the security examination of smart contracts, we use MythX. Static analysis, symbolic execution, and input fuzzing are used to find security flaws and ensure that the smart contract code is valid.

### Tenderly

- Tenderly is used for smart contract monitoring, alerting, debugging, and simulation in real time.
