# Upgradability in Smart Contracts

Smart contracts can be upgraded to modify their code, while preserving their address, state, and balance. This allows to iteratively add new features to the project, or fix any bugs found in production.

We use UUPS(Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) for upgrading smart contracts.
We don’t have a schedule to upgrade contracts but do it on per need basis. Contract versions start from V1.0.0, and based on what we have changed, patch or minor or major, we’ll change version names accordingly.
