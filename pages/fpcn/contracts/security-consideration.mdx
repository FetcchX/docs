# Security Considerations

### Default Function Visibility

In solc < 0.5.0 functions are public by default if a function visibility type is not specified. If a developer neglected to specify the visibility and a malevolent user is able to perform illegal or unintentional state changes, this might result in a vulnerability.
Explicit function visibility specifiers are necessary for solc >= 0.5.0.

### Access Control

Access controls define the restrictions around privileges and roles of users in an application. Access control in smart contracts can be related to governance and critical logic like minting tokens, voting on proposals, withdrawing funds, pausing and upgrading the contracts, changing ownership, etc.

### Uninitialized Storage Pointer

The EVM can store data as storage, memory, or calldata. Uninitialized local storage variables may point to unintended contract storage locations, creating security holes.
This problem has been systematically fixed as of compiler version 0.5.0 and above since contracts with uninitialized storage references no longer compile
