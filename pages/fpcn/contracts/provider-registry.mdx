# Provider Registry

Provider Registry contract is responsible for registering identities by the provider. This contract gets deployed after a provider has acquired a unique namespace. The following input data is needed for registration of ids by the provider.

```json
{
  "id": "satyam@fetcch",
  "pid": "1213edscxz",
  "pidType": "IPFS",
  "address": {
    "default": "0x0000",
    "others": ["0x0000", "0x0000"]
  },
  "merkelRoot": "0x000000",
  "signature": "0x000000" // only if msg.sender isn't address.default
}
```

Ownership of identities will be with their respective `address.default` and a multisig of `address.other`
Provider can modify data on any identity with valid signatures from either of the two.
