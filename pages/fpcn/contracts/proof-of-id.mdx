# Proof of ID

**Provider Registry** needs **Proof of ID** to be able to create new IDs in their namespace.

**Proof of ID** is data in format

```json
{
  "id": "satyam@fetcch",
  "pid": "1213edscxz",
  "pidType": "IPFS",
  "address": {
    "default": "0x0000",
    "others": ["0x0000", "0x0000"]
  },
  "merkelRoot": "0x000000",
  "signature": "0x000000" // only if msg.sender isn't address.default
}
```

Anybody could verify IDs using `merkleRoot` present on the chain.
`signature` is needed when PID is updated by non `address.default` as `msg.sender`
