# Signed Messages

**FPCN** supports almost all of the major blockchains and many blockchains have different signing algorithms, we support verification of all of those algorithms, and signatures should be in the format

```json
{
  "id": "satyam@fetcch",
  "message": {
    // will be stringified id
  },
  "signature": {
    "signature": "0x000",
    "type": "ecdsa",
    "timestamp": "",
    "pubKey": "0x00"
  }
}
```

This helps owners retain ownership of their own identities while doing off-chain stuff or relying on providers/relayers to do on/off-chain stuff.
