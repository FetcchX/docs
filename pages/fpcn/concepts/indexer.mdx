# Indexer

All of the data is stored on a decentralized storage solution and ownership is managed on ethereum.

We can’t run heavy computation work on blockchains due to their technical limitation and that’s why we’ve built an indexer which enables us to do exactly that.

Fetcch Indexer is a completely trustless technological piece that exposes a GraphQL API for developers to access various add-on functions of FPCN.
